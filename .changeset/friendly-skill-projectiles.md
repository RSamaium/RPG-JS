Add a persistent server-authoritative, type-extensible hotbar for skills, items, and custom gameplay entries. The hotbar now supports a dynamic 1–10 slot capacity, retained locked-slot assignments, unlock hints, a persistent active slot, automatic refresh after level/class/inventory/map changes, direct keyboard shortcuts, a radial gamepad selector, LT/RT slot cycling with X activation, mobile centering, cooldown/cost/quantity presentation, and serialized `instant`, `select`, or `target` activation handlers.

Replace Action Battle's dedicated `ui.actionBar` and component with the generic `ui.hotbar`. Action Battle skills enrich generic entries with targeting, cooldown, projectile, sound, animation, and visual metadata while their authoritative execution continues through native skill and item hooks. This is an intentional breaking configuration and export cleanup.

Keep direct 1–0 Zelda-style menu assignment, display unavailable slots with their unlock condition in the root-level assignment picker, execute Studio skill workflows through the native `onUse` hook, make instant skills soft-target without a confirmation step, preserve skill impact media through AI damage feedback, and add translated Studio presentation fields, visual area targeting, phase-specific CanvasEngine cast/trail/impact presets, a default projectile renderer compatible with Studio skill records, and robust object-signal hydration for class and hotbar sync payloads. Upgrade to `@signe/sync` 3.1.1 so object-signal hydration uses the upstream fix without a local package patch.
